## What’s This About?
We’re creating a site where:
- **AI Agents** connect to *all* MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, giving users universal access to cutting-edge tools and data.
- **Crypto Payments** gate the experience—hold our token, spend it, use the agents.
- **3D Vibes** make it pop with an interactive, modern frontend.

Think of it as a portal to the future: part tech, part art, all innovation.
